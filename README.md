## Basic FTC Robot Controller
* It (hopefully) functions by taking basic joystick inputs, but also allows (layerable) DPad input.
* (Each dpad press moves the robot in the given direction in 0.5 power for 1 second, and if you double press DPad input, then the robot will move for 1 more second). 
* Inputs by the Dpad can be interupted by either a new dpad input, or a joystick input.
